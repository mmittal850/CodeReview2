<FILL IN HERE 100 - 200 words>

Task 3: UML class diagram describing superclasses and interfaces is provided in a separate file.

Task 4: UML class diagram describing non-inheritance associations involving other classes is provided in a separate file. We have provided a SVG document, which shows the Associations with arrows, but it is a bit crowded, due to the sheer number of associations. Thus, we have also provide a task 4.java file, showing the associations explicitly through plantuml notation. This UML was generated using www.plantuml.com.
