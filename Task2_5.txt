Task 5: What we have leared from this Code Review
While revieweing the clipboard service source code in the Android framework codebase, we have learnt how data is copied to the clipboard and placed in a new target location. This involves user profile management, synchronous thread execution, user permission management, and text handling for clipboard service. This has also helped us understand the Java programming principles of implementation of interface, nested classes, and function overriding.
